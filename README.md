This is my ITW-2 Project 

I have built a Web app using Django Framework which uses python language

This web app is a Study App which can be used to connect people who are studying a topic , so that they can form a group and discuss about the topic
This is done using creating study rooms where people using  this app can come and join by messaging in it . As of now all the rooms are public and is universally usable
